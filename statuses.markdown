## Statuses Explained


### Auction Statuses
1. Ongoing:
The auction is currently in progress. Bidders can place bids, and the item is available for purchase until the specified end time.

2. Sold:
The auction has concluded successfully, and the item has been sold to the highest bidder. The winning bidder has met or exceeded the reserve price, if applicable.

3. Cancelled:
The auction has been canceled before its scheduled end time. This status may be applied in exceptional circumstances, such as the withdrawal of the item or unforeseen issues.

4. Reserve Price Not Met:
The auction has concluded, but the reserve price, a minimum acceptable bid set by the seller, has not been met. As a result, the item remains unsold, and the transaction is not completed.

### Reserve Statuses
1. Reserve:
The auction listing has a reserve price set by the seller. Bidders must meet or exceed this predetermined minimum bid for the item to be sold. If the reserve price is not met by the end of the auction, the item remains unsold.

2. No Reserve:
The auction listing has no reserve price set by the seller. The highest bid, regardless of its value, at the end of the auction period secures the successful purchase of the item. This approach allows the item to be sold to the highest bidder, irrespective of a minimum bid requirement.
